==[ COMPILING ]==
To build the ircd, run:
./Config
make
./makeall

Since you should be using the src directory for installing,
you do not need to do 'make install'

==[ BOOTING YOUR IRCD ]==
Just type: ./unreal start
Note that after booting the errors are usually logged to ircd.log,
so check that file if you have any problems.
Again, check the FAQ (and docs) if you have any boot problems.
